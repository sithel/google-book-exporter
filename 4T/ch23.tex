\textbf{{[}25 Tokens from last session{]}}



Jaya and Lackovich shoot at the retreating Orc but miss as she disappears into the darkness in the next room.  Oliver is winded, but manages to explain that the Orc is a woman, not a man.



Jonah climbs up the ladder to treat Oliver.  He fumbles the diagnosis {[}\textit{Refresh: Street Medic 2 (Jonah)}{]}.  Jaya and Lackovich run after the Orc.



Hayley, still on the ground floor, asks which way the Orc went and Jaya yells ``The dark way.''  Hayley takes her best guess as to what this means and heads around to another section of the Factory and comes across a darkened room.  Several armored figures are loading things or at least moving equipment and boxes around.  The equipment is the higher tech stuff that was in the 7th floor of the Apartment Tower.



The figures notice Hayley and raise their rifles.  She backs away slowly, her pistol in one hand but not aimed at anything.  Above her, a raspy voice says, ``Stop.''  Hayley looks around in confusion and keeps backing up to see where the voice is coming from.  She eventually sees the dark figure on the gangplank above her.



Jaya turns the corner and sees the Orc.  She lunges at the Orc at the same time Lackovich opens fire.  The Orc slides back and rolls to face the attackers.  The figures on the floor open fire, as do additional soldiers entering on the other end of the gangplanks.



{[}\textit{Challenge 3: Avoid bullets and close with the Orc.  Armor 2 (Jaya) + Senior Constable 2 (Jaya) + Sidearm 3 (Jaya)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{3 VP (Jaya)}}{]}  Jaya takes a few hits to her armor and her holster for her sidearm takes some pretty severe damage, but she manages to reach the Orc without any major injuries.   The two of them start punching and kicking the crap out of each other



Still back in the other room upstairs, Oliver and Jonah are arguing about treatment and diagnosis, but eventually they get Oliver patched up. {[}\textit{Reduce Flaw Winded 2 (Oliver).  Street Medic 2 (Jonah) → }\textit{Flaw: Winded 1 (Oliver)}\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}. } }\textit{ }\textit{Reduce Flaw 1 (Oliver).  MedKit 1 (Oliver) → }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: slightly winded 0 (Oliver)} }{]}.  



Below, Hayley is knocked down by the gunfire, although her armor soaks most of the damage.  She rolls behind a metal girder and stays down to present less of a target.  She reports over the radio that there are 6 guys on the floor and 2 more on the gangplanks.  She says she is shooting at them.  They are taking cover behind some crates.  Hayley fires at them but mostly uses the gauss pistol to shred their cover.



Jaya headbutts the Orc and breaks her nose, which is very satisfying.  The Orc returns the favor.  {[}\textit{Challenge 3: Stop the Orc from getting up.  Adrenaline Junkie 2 (Jaya) → Sent back to pool}{]}.  {[}\textit{Challenge 1: Notice.  Stash 2 (Jaya)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{1 VP (Jaya)}}{]}  Brawling face to face, Jaya hears the faint pop and hiss noise and sees the Orc's eyes dilate- she can tell the Orc just received some kind of drug injection... somehow?  The Orc punches Jaya really hard.



Oliver takes apart his gun {[}\textit{Refresh: Sniper Rifle 3 (Oliver)}{]}.   {[}\textit{Challenge1:  Notice.  Trigger Reflexes 1 (Jonah) → Matched}{]}.  A guy comes around the corner into the room where Oliver and Jonah are. Jonah notices him and gets the drop on him.  He kills the guy and then takes the guy's machine gun.  Oliver pays little attention, focused on fixing his gun {[}\textit{Reduce Flaw: Damaged Gun 2 (Oliver).  Focused 4 (Oliver) → }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: Slightly Damaged Gun 1 (Oliver)} }{]}



The Orc grabs Jaya by the throat and starts choking her.  Hayley tries shooting at the Orc, but the angle is bad.  She tries climbing up one of the support beams to help but the soldiers on the floor fire at her and she falls {[}\textit{Refresh: Athletics 3 (Hayley)}{]}.  



Jaya is thrown off the catwalk and falls to the ground, breaking some ribs.  She crawls to the side of the room and rummages around in the broken crates to find herself a replacement truncheon.  Preferably one with nails in it.  {[}\textit{Refresh: Truncheon 3 (Jaya)}{]}. 



Lackovich cries out as the Orc starts pummeling the crap out of her.



{[}\textit{Challenge 1: Notice.  Process Wonk 2 (Hayley)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{1 VP (Hayley)}}{]}.  Hayley notices something odd about the soldiers on the ground floor.  They are moving in eerie unison, advancing smoothly, and yet she can see no evidence of them communicating with each other.



Oliver and Jonah enter into the larger room with everyone.  The Orc is holding up Lackovich's mostly insensible body as a shield of sorts, though she's still punching her.  {[}\textit{Operator 1 (Oliver)}{]} Oliver tells Hayley to do something to distract the Orc.  Oliver decides to shoot the Orc through Lackovich anyway {[}\textit{Refresh: Hardened 4 (Oliver)}{]}.



{[}\textit{Challenge 5: Shoot Orc in the leg (to cripple or slow).  Sniper Rifle 3 (Oliver) + Crack Shot 3 (Oliver) + Gauss Pistol 2 (Jonah) +Small Arms 2 (Jonah) + Athletics 3 (Hayley)  → Matched}{]}



{[}\textit{Challenge 2: Help Lackovich not get shot.  Agent 1  (Jaya) + Air of Command 2  (Jaya) + }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: Shot 1 (Jaya)} }\textit{  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{2 VP (Jaya)}}{]}.



Hayley throws a chunk of metal scrap up to bang into the gangplank, going for maximum noise.  The Orc turns toward the distraction, and Jonah and Oliver fire at her while Jaya steps into the line of fire to yell at Lackovich for her to duck.  Lackovich can tell Jaya's serious because she actually uses Lackovich's name. 



Oliver shoots the Orc in the leg and she falls.  The air shimmers around her and she stands again, painfully.  Her mask has fallen away and Oliver can clearly see the pain, anger and ferocity in her horribly burned face.  Strands of red hair have pulled free from her braid.



``How's it feel?'' yells Oliver.



The Orc growls, ``\hl{You can no more hurt nor kill me than my sister could}\footnote{\textbf{q.google }So, was she wrong?  Or does she know something we don't? ;)
We need to ask the Sisters G about this. \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:09pm}}.''



Oliver takes aim, but his gun jams {[}\textit{Refresh: Sniper Rifle 3 (Oliver)}{]}



Below, Jaya takes a moment to rummage through her drug inventory {[}\textit{Refresh: Stash 2 (Jaya)}{]}



Hayley fires at the Orc from below, but the bullets deflect around her.



Jonah sees that one of the other soldiers on the gangplank is advancing.  He fires at the guy and knocks him down.  Jonah then retreats back to the other room and climbs down the ladder.



Hayley realizes that Jaya's absorbed in reviewing her Stash contents, and she steps out into the open, knowing exactly where to stand to shield Jaya, even though it leaves Hayley unprotected.  {[}\textit{Refresh: Saltaremachy 2 (Hayley)}{]}



The Orc steps closer to Oliver and reaches for his throat.  ``In fact, you can no more kill me than my sister could save me.''



``She didn't send me here to save you,'' replies Oliver and he fires at her point blank.



{[}\textit{Challenge 4: }\textit{\hl{Grievously hinder the Orc's life}}\footnote{\textbf{Suko T }One of my favorite challenge titles to date.  I believe credit goes to Nate? \textsubscript{04/02/14 4:14pm}}\textit{.  Sniper Rifle 3 (Oliver) + }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: Destroyed gun 3 (Oliver) } }\textit{→ Matched}{]}.  The rifle passes through the field around the Orc, but something goes terribly wrong when he pulls the trigger.  The rifle explodes.  The Orc manages to grab his neck but the explosion flings them back against the catwalk's rails.  Oliver is burned and there is blood everywhere.



``Morgan didn't, but I doubt that Kate did,'' growls the Orc.  Oliver hears a ``pop!'' and a portal opens up under the gangplank where the Orc is.  Hayley moves to try to do something to catch the Orc before she escapes into the portal but it's at chest height and very difficult to maneuver around.



One of the soldiers on the ground runs past Jaya to jump through the portal, but she kneecaps him. 



Oliver pulls out a knife.  ``Kate's just trying to save me now, \hl{but that's not working out either,''}\footnote{\textbf{Suko T }loved this line \textsubscript{04/02/14 4:13pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{Rebecca S. }ditto.  I can close my eyes and see the dramatic anime art style this whole exchange plays out, to compliment the Oliver/Kate exchange in the rain sessions ago \textsubscript{04/24/14 8:30pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{Suko T }+1 \textsubscript{04/24/14 9:30pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{q.google }+1 \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:10pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{Nathaniel Ford }+1 Quick! Someone write a screenplay. \textsubscript{05/26/14 9:34pm}} he says, and stabs her.  {[}\textit{Challenge 5: Kill the Orc.  Hardened 4 (Oliver) + }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: Over the Edge 4 (Oliver) } }\textit{→ Matched}{]}.  Oliver falls into the portal and Hayley can't stop it though she tries.  ``Should I follow?'' she asks over the radio and outloud (so that Jaya can hear it).  In her mind, Oliver says, ``No.''



There is a second ``pop!'' and another portal appears on the ground floor.  In unison, all of the guys (except two) change direction and head toward the second portal.  One guy goes to pick up kneecapped guy, and the other aims a gun at Jaya's head.



Jonah enters the room to see Jaya moving to block anyone from entering the second portal.  {[}\textit{Challenge 5.  Keep the soldiers from getting through the portal.  Stash 2 (Jaya) + Truncheon 3 (Jaya) + Gauss Pistol 2 (Hayley) + }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw: Severed Arm 4 (Jaya)} }\textit{ → Matched}{]}



Hayley shoots a few of the guys but Jaya is hopped up on drugs and really lays into them- punching and tossing them around.   None of them get past her.  As she pulls her arm back to smash one of their heads in, there is a second ``pop!'' and the portal closes, right around her arm.  \hl{Most of her forearm vanishes, leaving a charred stump behind}\footnote{\textbf{q.google }Hey, at least there was no bleeding.  From a battlefield medic POV that has to be considered a win. \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:12pm}}, nauseatingly twisted and warped into a sort of spike.  Jaya passes out.  



The two remaining soldiers who are mobile make a break for it.  Hayley runs after them but they split up and toss smoke grenades behind them.  She chases after one and shoots him dead.  When she turns to track down the other, she is suddenly elsewhere.  She's lying down and there is pain, then the spreading numbness of drugs.  There is a sense of greenery and blue sky.  A face leans into her field of view.  It is Octavia, who smiles sadly and says, ``It seems,'' she pauses, ``that Morgan got her wish.  Too bad for your friends.  I wish you hadn't killed her.  They are all going to die.  But they will have it easy.  You will be worse than dead.''  Then Hayley is abruptly back in Borroughs again.  She goes back to the Factory.



Jonah goes back upstairs.  He cautiously skirts around the Orc, who is still breathing but not moving.  He checks on Lackovich, which is barely breathing.  He stabilizes her and calls for Hayley to come help carry her down the ladder.



Hayley approaches the Orc cautiously.  She looks at Hayley.  Hayley is surprised that the Orc appears to be a woman, not a man, and she wonders if this is another constituent.  The Orc tells her, ``You should leave.''  Hayley asks why, but instead of answering her, the Orc says, ``Say goodbye to my sisters.  I'll be seeing them soon.''  And she dies.  Hayley watches curiously and then picks up the body to take it downstairs.



{[}\textbf{Vengeance of Octavia}\textbf{\hl{n}}\footnote{\textbf{q.google }That *n* really has me going.... \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:13pm}}\textbf{ Triggered: 40}\textbf{ Tokens}\textbf{ enter the Pool}\footnote{\textbf{Suko T }Oops.  My bad.  :) \textsubscript{04/02/14 4:15pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{q.google }Deedee, *no*! \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:12pm}}{]}



Jonah looks at the bodies of the dead soldiers.  Their faces are young and well groomed. They have the distorted stroke-victim look that the guy in the Apartment Tower did.



{[}\textit{Challenge 2: Notice incoming aircraft}\textit{???}\textit{.  Vigilant 3 (Jonah)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{2 VP (Jonah)}}{]}  Jonah can hear, far in the distance, some incoming aircraft.



Jaya wakes up, in shock. She hasn't quite realized what happened to her arm yet.



{[}\textit{Challenge 1: Notice.  Small Unit Tactics 2 (Jonah)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{1 VP (Jonah)}}{]}.  Jonah can hear gunfire in the distance.



Jonah tells Hayley to drop the body of the Orc and help him carry Lackovich and Jaya back to the Station.  Hayley doesn't immediately comply.  She stares at the face of the Orc for a long time, and searches the body.  She eventually heads downstairs and helps Lackovich to her feet.



Jaya refuses to leave, looking for her hand,\hl{but Jonah convinces her that he stashed it in her pack and they set out}\footnote{\textbf{Rebecca S. }one of my favoritest Jonah moments! \textsubscript{04/24/14 8:33pm}}\footnote{$\rightarrow$\textbf{q.google }One of my favorite Jonah/Jaya conversations :).  There's a kind of crazy poetry to it. \textsubscript{05/01/14 12:16pm}}- Jonah helping Jaya, Hayley helping/carrying Lackovich.



Not far from the Factory, there is another ``pop!'' and 12 people fall out of a portal.  They don't seem to be expecting a different orientation coming out of the portal, but they recover and start shooting.  They are dressed in plain brown clothes and they seem shorter than us.



{[}\textit{Challenge 2: Don't get shot.  Saltaremachy 2 (Hayley) → Matched}{]}.  Hayley manages to maneuver herself and Lackovich out of the way of the gunfire.



The top of the Apartment Tower explodes.  There is a surge of panicked people that starts rushing toward the TA Station, and we are at the front of that wave.



{[}\textit{Challenge 2 (for each): Stay ahead of the wave of panicked populace.   Truncheon 3 (Jaya)  → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{2 VP (Jaya)}}\textit{.  Streetwise 3  (Jonah) → Overcome! }\textit{\textbf{2 VP (Jonah)}}\textit{. Bodyguard 1 (Hayley) + Unashamed 1 (Hayley)  → Matched}{]}.  Jaya clears her way, swinging her Truncheon.  Jonah figures out shortcuts and knows the best way back to the Station.  Hayley just hangs onto Lackovich and shoves anyone, men, women, small children, out of her way.  The air is full of smoke and panic.



Jonah sees some TA constables run by.  He conscripts three of them into helping, overruling their previous orders to report to some corner in the city.  Hayley asks if she should go back for the Orc's body, gets stubborn when told not to, but eventually gives in and keeps going toward the TA Station.



Jonah radios Rook and tells him to come get them.  Rook asks what's going on.  Jonah can't spare the time to tell him much, other than they are wounded and it's bad.  Rook says he'll have to pull into the secondary station and he'll be there in five minutes.  We'd better be there because he can't stay.  While talking with Rook, Jonah loses track of what is going on around him.  {[}\textit{Refresh: Vigilant 3 (Jonah)}{]}



It is pandemonium at the TA Station.  The crowds are pressed to the gates, demanding to be let in.  The TA constables look overwhelmed.  Jaya grabs one of the pistols from the TA agents helping carry Lackovich.  He looks like he wants to protest but doesn't stop her when she glares at him. {[}\textit{Refresh: Sidearm 3 (Jaya)}{]}



{[}\textit{Challenge 4.  Get through the crowd to the station.  Sidearm 3 (Jaya) + Vigilant 3 (Jonah)  → Matched}{]}.  Jaya fires her gun into the air and Jonah finds the weaknesses in the crowd and we break through.  The TA constables are pissed because we just made their job harder as the crowd surges through the hole we just made.  Inside the station, the dust and debris of a recent explosion are still settling.



A second train arrives on the far track.  The Conductor is checking his schedule and yelling that this train is not on the schedule. We walk right past him and to the second track.  One of the conscripted TA constables decides to do his duty and turns back to help out at the station.  The other two shrug and get on the train with us.



Jonah treats Jaya's GSW with the few remaining supplies left and we head back to SAC-09.  {[}\textit{Reduce Flaw: Shot 1.  Medkit 1 (Hayley) →  }\textit{ {\color[RGB]{255,0,0}Flaw 0 Gunshot scar (Jaya)} }{]}
